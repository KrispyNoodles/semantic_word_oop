# üß† semantic_word_oop

A fun side project that explores **word semantics** through **object-oriented programming** and **pretrained word embeddings**.

This Python class lets you perform vector arithmetic on words‚Äîsuch as:

```python
king - man + woman = queen
```

## üîç What It Does

- Loads a pretrained word embedding model (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec).
- Creates an instance of each word with attributes such as the original text and its corresponding vector.
- Supports intuitive vector arithmetic using operator overloading:
  - + for vector addition  
  - - for vector subtraction
- Prevents repeated use of words in analogy chains by applying stem-based exclusion, managed through a class-level variable `EXCLUDED_STEMS`.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from word_vector import WordVector

king = WordVector("king")
man = WordVector("man")
woman = WordVector("woman")

result = king - man + woman
result

# to ensure that the result isnt removed (making it repeatable)
WordVector.EXCLUDED_STEMS = []
```
